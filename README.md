**DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics**

## **DOMAIN**

Retail Analytics in the Electronics Industry.

## **TECHNOLOGY USED**

* Python 3.12  
* MySQL 8.0  
* Power Bi  
* Matplotlib  
* Seaborn

## **SKILL-TAKEAWAY**

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, EDA,Python, Data Management using SQL, Power Bi.

# **Business use cases:**

By analysing data on Global Electronics' customers, products, sales, and stores, we aim to uncover critical insights that can refine marketing strategies, streamline inventory management, and enhance sales forecasting. These insights will support more targeted marketing campaigns, inform product development, guide promotion planning, and influence decisions on store expansions and optimizations. Furthermore, understanding the effects of currency exchange rates on sales will enable more effective international pricing strategies. Ultimately, these findings will contribute to higher customer satisfaction and foster business growth for Global Electronics.

## **Approach:**

## **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

Identify and address any missing values in the dataset. Ensure proper data type conversions where required, such as for dates and numerical fields. Combine datasets when needed for analysis, such as linking sales data with product and customer information.

## **Load Data**

Load the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating appropriate tables for each data source and using SQL INSERT commands to populate the tables with the data.

## **Power BI Visualization**

Establish a connection between SQL and Power BI, import the data, and design interactive dashboards for visualisation.

## **Develop SQL Queries**

Develop and run SQL queries to retrieve essential insights from the data. These queries should focus on answering critical business questions and align with the following analysis steps.

## **Analysis Steps:**

## **Customer Analysis and Demographic Distribution:**

To analyse the distribution of customers based on gender, age (calculated from birthday), and location (city, state, country, continent) in a more visual and intuitive way.  
**Purchase Patterns:**

Analyse purchasing patterns by determining metrics such as the average order value, purchase frequency, and most popular products.

## **Segmentation:**

Categorise customers based on their demographics and buying behaviour to pinpoint significant customer segments.

**Sales Analysis**

* **Overall Sales Performance:** Examine total sales trends over time, identifying any patterns or seasonal fluctuations.  
* **Sales by Product:** Determine which products achieve the highest sales volumes and revenue.  
* **Sales by Store:** Evaluate sales performance across various stores.  
* **Sales by Currency:** Analyse how different currencies affect sales figures, taking exchange rates into account.

**Product Analysis**

* **Product Popularity:** Identify which products are the most and least popular based on sales data.  
* **Profitability Analysis:** Assess profit margins by comparing the cost per unit with the selling price.  
* **Category Analysis:** Review sales performance across various product categories and subcategories.

**Store Analysis**

* **Store Performance:** Assess store performance based on sales figures, store size (in square metres), and operational data (such as the date of opening).  
* **Geographical Analysis:** Analyse sales performance by store location to identify high-performing regions.

**Results:**

Upon project completion, learners are expected to provide a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report for Global Electronics. This report will feature clean, integrated datasets and offer detailed insights into customer demographics, purchasing behaviours, product performance, store operations, and the impact of currency on sales. The report will include engaging visualisations and actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing marketing strategies, optimising inventory management, improving sales forecasting, guiding product development, and informing store expansion and operational decisions. The analysis will help Global Electronics increase customer satisfaction, maximise revenue, and drive overall business growth.
